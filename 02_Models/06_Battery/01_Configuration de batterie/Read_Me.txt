This is a Matlab program which provide you a reference for you final configuration. In this folder, you can find also a .mat file based on the first configuration of our battery. It inclures the entry parameters and also the result, which is all automatically saved by the program.
P.S. For the people who is now familiar with Mathlab, if you want to load the .mat, just find it in the menu of matlab's window at double-click it. If you want to change the paramters while the program is running, just find it in workspace and enter to modify it also by  a simple double-click.
I wish you a happy usage !
